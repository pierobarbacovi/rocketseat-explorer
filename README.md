This is a way to document my journey as a WebDev aspirer üöÄ

Here you'll find coursework projects and exercises I'm gathering throughout my experience on the Explorer course at Rocketseat, as well as other little projects I do along the way.

If you like this way of documenting your journey, feel free to fork it and use it your own way.

I'd appreciate it if you say thanks by ‚≠ê starring this repo or sharing your thoughts with me.

Also, please get in touch if I can help you with anything!
